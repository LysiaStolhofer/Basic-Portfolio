                            <p>I am born and raised in Germany. In 2014, when I was 22, I moved to Connecticut to be an Au Pair. After 2 Years I decided to study Computer Science in the US. I am graduading from NCC in two semesters and I would love to move to Canada. 
                            </p><p>My hobbies are playing piano, traveling and drawing, this is why I went for a Bachelor degree in Fashion Design in Europe when I still used to live there. I don't own any pets, because they make me feel trapped. But I love to collect workout clothes and sneakers, since another huge hobby of mine is doing Crossfit. 
                            </p><p> In my free time I love to see my friends, kayaking, Rock climbing or to travel all over the US and Canada. I live in a host family since 5 years who's kids I am also nannying. I have 5 sibling so I grew up in a big family on the country side, in a small village in South-West Germany. I miss my home a lot sometimes, especially the food and traditions we have at home, but I am so glad I found a second family in the US.
